# Wings of Glove
An interactive installation for a school project in human-computer interaction with focus on using input/output beyond what is typical in computing (keyboards, mice, etc…).

[![A video demo of the 3D world](http://github.com/einarlove/wings-of-glove/raw/master/readme-files/link-to-video.jpg?raw=true)](http://f.cl.ly/items/2r2y0c1Y1E1U3m3d3N2Q/demo-of-wings-of-glove.webmhd.webm)

## Concept
The concept for the installation was to relive the experience we had as a child when we ran around and used our arm to imitate a plane or a bird flying.

It was built by mounting an Arduino microcontroller with a gyroscope sensor to a gardening glove to track the hand movement, a controllable hawk in an endless 3D world built with webGL, and a Node.js server which did intercommunication through webSockets.

We were proud and honored for being awarded "Gullspiren", an award given by the school jury to the best student work in each field at graduation.

## Demo
The real experience lies with the interaction through the glove, but you can [try out the 3D world](http://einarlove.com/view/wingsofglove/) by using your keyboard arrows.
