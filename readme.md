# Wings of Glove
An interactive installation for a school project in human-computer interaction with focus on using input/output beyond what is typical in computing (keyboards, mice, etc…).

## Concept
The concept for the installation was to relive the experience we had as a child when we ran around and used our arm to imitate a plane or a bird flying.

It was built by mounting an Arduino microcontroller with a gyroscope sensor to a gardening glove to track the hand movement, A controllable hawk in an endless 3D world built with webGL, and a Node.js server which did intercommunication through webSockets.

We were proud and honored for being awarded "Gullspiren", an award given by a jury from the school to the best student work in each field at the graduation.

## Demo
The real experience lies with the interaction through the glove, but you can [try out the 3D world](http://htmlpreview.github.io/einarlove/wings-of-glove/blob/master/The-3D-world/index.html) by using your keyboard arrows.
